# Demo 2 - Xamarin.Forms

This demo showed the power of Xamarin.Forms! It demonstrated how to build a sweet user interface and then it also showed how to invoke several device-specific features ... _all from the shared code layer_ including geo-location, wifi, and network connectivity.

All the various plug-ins for Xamarin that allow you to access device specific functionality from the core project layer can be viewed [on GitHub here](https://msou.co/bf1).

Several portions of Azure were also demonstrated including:

* [Azure Functions](https://msou.co/bfz)
* [CosmosDB](https://msou.co/bf0)
* [Azure Active Directory](https://msou.co/bfy)
